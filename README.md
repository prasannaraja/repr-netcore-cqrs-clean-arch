# Minimal API Microservices
This repository showcases a sample project demonstrating the implementation of a .NET Core application using the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern along with Clean Architecture principles and REPR Pattern Endpoints in .NET 8. The project is designed to illustrate best practices for structuring modern .NET applications, ensuring maintainability, testability, and scalability.

Key Features:

 - .NET Core: Utilizes the latest features and capabilities of .NET Core
   for building robust and performant applications.
 - CQRS Pattern: Separates read and write operations to enhance
   performance and scalability.
 - Clean Architecture: Promotes a clean separation of concerns, making
   the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
 - REPR Pattern Endpoints (.NET 8): Implements REPR (RESTful,
   Event-driven, Process-oriented, Reactive) pattern endpoints
   introduced in .NET 8 to modernize and streamline API development.
 - Dependency Injection: Leverages .NET Core's built-in DI to manage
   dependencies and promote loose coupling.
 - Entity Framework Core: Utilizes EF Core for database operations,
   showcasing best practices for data access.

Whether you're looking to understand the CQRS pattern, explore Clean Architecture, or build scalable .NET applications using the latest .NET 8 features, this repository provides a solid foundation and practical insights.
